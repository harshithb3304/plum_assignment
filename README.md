2. Problem Understanding
------------------------

**Problem**: Provide personalized, actionable wellness tips tailored to a user's age, gender, and wellness goals using AI-generated recommendations.

**Assumptions**: 
- Users provide basic demographic information for personalization
- AI-generated content is advisory and not medical advice
- Local storage of the browser is used for data persistence (profile, tips, favorites)
- Modern browsers with support for CSS animations and backdrop filters
- Users can save favorite tips and export them as PDF documents or copy them to their device's clipboard.

3. AI Prompts & Iterations
--------------------------

**AI Integration**: Google Gemini models with fallback to lower models in case of API over usage.

**Initial Prompt Strategy**: 
```
Generate 5 personalized wellness tips for a [age]-year-old [gender] with goals: [goals]. 
For each tip, provide:
1. A catchy, concise title (max 8 words)
2. A brief description (max 20 words)
3. A relevant emoji icon
4. A category (nutrition, exercise, mental-health, sleep, lifestyle)

Format as JSON array with this structure:
[
  {
    "title": "string",
    "shortDescription": "string",
    "icon": "emoji",
    "category": "string"
  }
]

Make tips actionable, age-appropriate, and goal-specific. Keep them engaging and motivational.
```

**Issues Encountered**:
- Inconsistent emoji icons and tip formatting
- Markdown artifacts in generated content
- Duplicate favorites when tips regenerated

**Refinements Made**:
- Added strict JSON schema requirements for consistent output
- Implemented unique tip ID system (timestamp + sessionId + index)
- Added content cleaning functions using regex to remove markdown artifacts
- Enhanced prompt with specific formatting instructions for steps and explanations
